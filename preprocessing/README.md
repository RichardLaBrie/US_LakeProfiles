# US_LakeProfiles
Data analysis of US lake profiles in 2007 and 2012. Data are taken from the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This project is part of an internship at Montreal University under the supervision of Drs Jean-Francois Lapierre, Roxane Maranger and Nicolas Fortin St-Gelais.

The objectives of our project was to investigate wether the stratification and stability of US lakes significatively changed between 2007 and 2012 at the continental scales. We also investigated how much the atmospheric temperature, the concentration in total phosphorus, the water color, the maximal depth and other lake metrics explained some metrics of lake stability (i.e. epilimnetic thickness, difference of temperature between the top and bottom layers, the hypoxic volume and the Schmidt stability).
