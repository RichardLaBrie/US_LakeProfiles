# figs

This folder contains every figure generated by the R scripts. The vast majority of them were generated from the script visualization.R. 

It is divided into 9 sub-folders, which refer to different types of charts: 


1. box_plots
depth_type_boxplot.pdf : boxplot of maximum sampled depth faceted with lake type

2. density_plots
density_plots_numeric.pdf : density plots of key numeric variables, in 2007 and 2012
depth_type_density.pdf : density plot of maximum sampled depth according to lake types (before type simplification)

3. histograms
depth_type.pdf : histogram of maximum sampled depth according to lake types (after type simplification)

4. maps
